TODO list
==========

* Service layer
  * Fix bugs
  * Filter URLs correctly
  * Make sure we have no risk for exceptions
  * Improve umot to be fail safe
    
* Create a better solution for existing links

  Right now every time we see a link, we need to check the database if
  it's already in there or it's a new link. This is extremely
  inefficient, find out a new solution for this.
 
* Update requirements.txt
